# Inkwell Code of Conduct

*Note: This is not a legal document.*

The Inkwell team is committed to the following rules:

* Treat everyone fairly.
* Be kind and respectful to others.
* Judge technical problems and solutions, not people.
* Use polite language.
* In case of disagreement use arbitrage of position of authority and responsibility (eg. project owner).

We expect others to follow these rules as well.
